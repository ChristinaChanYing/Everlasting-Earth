                        <p>The image above is an art work made by Matthew Borrett, titled "A Future Toronto".</p><p> My interpretation of the artwork is that of a future in which humanity did not manage to reach sustainability, and subsequently must live in a dystopian society where resources are a scarcity and climate change has destroyed our civilization. </p><p>In an unsustainable future, we would have countless extinct species, complete fuel depletion, and a lack of food and other necessary recourses. A future world as such may not be that far off if we do not change and continue to use our resources the way we do. A future world as such is why we must change. </p>

                        <p>A sustainable future would be one in which all of humanity is able to feed themselves and starvation is eradicated. </p>
                        <p>Unrenewable resources such as coal are replaced by renewable resources like solar, electricity, and natural gas and the rate of climate change has drastically slow down. Electric vehicles powered with lithium-air batteries would be the market majority, and gasoline engines are illegal. One-time use plastic would be banned and the majority of our trash is either biodegradable or recyclable. </p><p>The age of selfish consumption would be over and people would only consume what they need. It would be a world in which there is equality across the globe with no lack of resources. Such a world sounds amazing, but unrealistic to most. However, a completely sustainable world like the one I describe is not impossible and it starts with you, and spreading more awareness. </p>
